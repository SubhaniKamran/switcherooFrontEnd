						Agreement. From time to time ICS Mortgages may need to contact you

					<h4 className="font-semibold  mt-6">Credit Checking and Reporting</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						Under the Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code, we are not
						permitted to offer you a credit product that you cannot afford.
						Therefore, in advance, of granting you a credit product of any type,
						we will check your credit rating against the Central Credit Register
						and the Irish Credit Bureau. This information supports a full and
						accurate assessment of your ability to repay. In addition, we are
						required by law to ensure that the Central Credit Register is kept
						up to date and we report personal and credit information to the
						Central Credit Register. We also report credit facilities to the
						Irish Credit Bureau (“ICB”) in the legitimate interests of the Bank
						and the ICB. Please see the ICB’s data protection notice, which is
						available at http://www.icb.ie/pdf/Fair Processing Notice.pdf for
						details of how the ICB will process your personal data, and how you
						may exercise your rights in respect of your personal data held by
						the ICB.
					</p>
					<h4 className="font-semibold  mt-6">Insurance Protection</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						To protect your home, you should arrange the appropriate insurances.
						ICS Mortgages requires buildings insurance in all cases and strongly
						recommends contents insurance. If the property is your principal
						residence, life insurance is compulsory by law, with certain
						exceptions.
					</p>
					<h4 className="font-semibold  mt-6">Arrears</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						Arrears are any element of a mortgage repayment that have not been
						made and remain outstanding. Interest at the mortgage rate will be
						applied to the outstanding balance of your loan which includes any
						payments missed. This may result in increased cost of credit.
					</p>
					<h4 className="font-semibold  mt-6">Valuation</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						Prior to getting mortgage approval from ICS Mortgages we will need a
						property valuation. The valuation needs to be completed by an ICS
						Mortgages approved valuer and you can contact us to arrange the
						valuation. You must pay a valuation fee, which will be a standard
						maximum fee of €185 (however the fee may be higher depending on the
						size of the property) which includes VAT but excludes valuer’s
						travel expenses. Final valuations: Properties incomplete at the time
						of the original valuation will require, on completion, a final
						valuation, the fee for which is €85.00 which includes VAT but
						excludes travel expenses.
					</p>
					<h4 className="font-semibold  mt-6">Other fees</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						By signing this form, you are agreeing that any fees you need to pay
						are detailed in our Fees and Charges Schedule for Mortgages which
						are available on https://www.icsmortgages.ie/. On approval of your
						mortgage we will debit the agreed monthly instalment of your
						mortgage using the preferred method of payment that you have
						specified in your mortgage application.
