						Transfer of Mortgages i.e. Securitisation
					</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						Your attention is drawn to the possibility that ICS Mortgages, in
						common with many other mortgage lenders worldwide, may decide to
						securitise some of its mortgages. Financial Institutions are limited
						in the amount they can lend by the level of their capital and, to
						release capital to capitalise future lending’s, including mortgage
						lending, mortgages may be transferred to investors.
						<br />
						This practice is known as securitisation. Relevant investors include
						the world’s major financial institutions. In practice, you should
						not be aware of any effect from securitisation because ICS Mortgages
						will continue to manage your mortgage, including the setting of
						interest rates and the handling of arrears, subject to the powers
						and discretion of the transferee under such a scheme.

						Responsible Lending – Our Approach
					</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						We have a responsibility to you to act as a prudent and responsible
						lender. That means that we will be open and honest with you in the
						manner in which we promote and offer our products. We will provide
						clear information on the cost of your borrowing and we will provide
						sufficient details in relation to fees, charges, and terms and
						conditions to enable you make an informed decision before entering
						into the transaction. Before advancing any facility, an assessment
						of your ability to meet the required repayments will be completed
						and any advance will be limited to the amount we believe will ensure
						you can meet repayments comfortably while still meeting other
						essential financial and lifestyle commitments. To assist us in this
						regard it is important that you provide us with a complete record of
						your financial affairs, particularly in relation to any non-bank
						commitments.

						Arrangements for repaying your mortgage
					</h4>
					<p className="text-gray-800">
						Your monthly mortgage repayment will be due on the last day of each
						month. Depending on when your funds are released , your first
						mortgage repayment may not occur within a calendar month following
						drawdown of the funds. Please note that the interest will start to
						accrue on your mortgage from the date the funds are released.
